## What is @fluei.xia?
>If you're wondering, *@fluei.xia* is the name I use to represent myself when I give handmade gifts to friends. The logo consists of a pink heart and the number *121%*, symbolizing my birthday on October 12th. More than just a date, the 121% reflects my wish for the recipients of my gifts to experience happiness that goes beyond 100%â€”a full 121% ðŸ’—
